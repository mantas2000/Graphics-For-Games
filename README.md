<h2>Ownership</h2>

● Just simply open project's folder in Unity Development Platform, open 'Scenes' folder and select 'Main Scene' scene to play.

● Q, E - to move up and down.\

<h2>Things done:</h2>
Apart from implementing all standart features, I also integrated some more advanced graphical effects:

● Permanent change to the planet surface (meteor crashing into terrain).\
● Space ship, clouds & northern lights in the sky.\
● A day/night cycle with appropriate lighting changes.
● A body of realistic looking water.\
● Planet surface extends as far as the eye can see.\
